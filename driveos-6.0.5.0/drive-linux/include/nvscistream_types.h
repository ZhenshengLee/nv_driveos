 * NvSciStream version:
 * It is expected that, when the NvSciStream library is being developed, it
 * might potentially be incompatible with previous versions. An application
 * built for a given major and minor version of NvSciStream will be compatible
 * with any NvSciStream library with the same major version and equal or
 * greater minor version.
 *
 * Different processes using different minor versions of NvSciStream libraries
 * with the same major version may share a stream as long as the stream does
 * not make use of any features not supported in the lower minor version.
 *
 * NvSciStream version numbers are incremented in the following circumstances:
 * - Major version:
 *   - A public interface is modified or removed, so as to make the library
 *     incompatible with applications built for a previous version.
 *   - A data structure used by the public interfaces is modified.
 *   - Existing message formats used by IPC blocks to communicate between
 *     processes are modified, or new messages are added for existing features.
 * - Minor version:
 *   - A new public interface or feature is added which does not affect
 *     applications using old features.
 *   - Additional values are added to existing enums which do not affect
 *     applications using old features.

 * section NvSciStream logical data types
 *  Block: A block is a modular portion of a stream which resides
 *  in a single process and manages one aspect of the stream's
 *  behavior. Blocks are connected together in a tree to form
 *  arbitrary streams.
 *
 *  NvSciStream supports the following types of blocks:
 *    - Producer: Producer is a type of block responsible for
 *      generating stream data. Each stream begins with a producer
 *      block, it is also referred to as the upstream endpoint of the
 *      stream.
 *
 *    - Consumer: Consumer is a type of block responsible for
 *      processing stream data. Each stream ends with one or
 *      more consumer blocks, it is also referred to as the
 *      downstream endpoint of the stream.
 *
 *    - Pool: Pool is a type of block containing the set of
 *      packets available for use by @a Producer. NvSciStream
 *      supports only a static pool in which the number of
 *      packets managed by the pool is fixed when the pool
 *      is created.
 *
 *    - Queue: Queue is a type of block containing set of
 *      packets available for use by @a Consumer.
 *      NvSciStream supports two types of queue blocks:
 *         - Fifo: A Fifo Queue block is used when all
 *           packets must be acquired by the consumer in
 *           the order received. Packets will wait in the FIFO
 *           until the consumer acquires them.
 *         - Mailbox: Mailbox Queue block is used when the consumer
 *           should acquire the most recent data. If a new
 *           packet is inserted in the mailbox when one
 *           is already waiting, the previous one will be skipped
 *           and its buffers will immediately be returned to the
 *           Producer for reuse.
 *
 *    - Multicast: Multicast is a type of block which is responsible
 *      for connecting separate pipelines when a stream has more than
 *      one Consumer.
 *
 *    - IpcSrc - IpcSrc is a type of block which is the upstream
 *      half of an IPC block pair which allows NvSciSyncObj waiter
 *      requirements, NvSciSyncObj(s), packet element
 *      information and packets to be transmitted to or received from
 *      the downstream half of the stream which resides in another
 *      process.
 *
 *    - IpcDst - IpcDst is a type of block which is the downstream
 *      half of an IPC block pair which allows NvSciSyncObj waiter
 *      requirements, NvSciSyncObj(s), packet element
 *      information and packets to be transmitted to or received from
 *      the upstream half of the stream which resides in another process.
 *
 *  Packet: A packet represents a set of NvSciBufObjs containing stream
 *  data, each NvSciBufObj it contains is also referred to as an element
 *  of the packet.
