 * @ingroup nvsci_group_stream
 * @{
 *
 * The NvSciSync library allows applications to manage synchronization
 * objects which coordinate when sequences of operations begin and end.
 *
 * The following constants are defined and have type @c unsigned @c int:
 * * @c NvSciSyncMajorVersion
 * * @c NvSciSyncMinorVersion
 *
 * In C and C++ these constants are guaranteed to be defined as global
 * const variables.

 * Upon each new release of NvSciSync:
 * * If the new release changes behavior of NvSciSync that could in any way
 *   prevent an application compliant with previous versions of this
 *   specification from functioning correctly, or that could prevent
 *   interoperability with earlier versions of NvSciSync, the major version is
 *   increased and the minor version is reset to zero.
 *   @note This is typically done only after a deprecation period.
 * * Otherwise, if the new release changes NvSciSync in any application
 *   observable manner (e.g., new features, or bug fixes), the major version is
 *   kept the same and the minor version is increased.
 * * Otherwise, the major and minor version are both kept the same.
 *
 * This version of this specification corresponds to NvSciSync version 1.0
 * (major version 1, minor version 0).
 *
 * Different processes using the NvSciSync inter-process APIs may use different
 * minor versions of NvSciSync within the same major version, provided that if
 * a process uses a feature newer than another processor's NvSciSync version,
 * the latter process does not import an unreconciled NvSciSyncAttrList (directly
 * or indirectly) from the former process.
 *
 * In general, an NvSciSync API call will not return an error code if it has
 * caused any side effects other than allocating resources and subsequently
 * freeing those resources.
 *
 * In general, unless specified otherwise, if a NULL pointer is passed to an
 * NvSciSync API call, the API call will either return ::NvSciError_BadParameter
 * or (if there are other applicable error conditions as well) an error code
 * corresponding to another error.
 *
 * Each NvSciSyncAttrList is either unreconciled or reconciled.
 * It is unreconciled if it was:
 * - Created by NvSciSyncAttrListCreate(),
 * - Created by a failed NvSciSyncAttrListReconcile() call,
 * - Created by a failed NvSciSyncAttrListReconcileAndObjAlloc() call, or
 * - An import of an export of one or more unreconciled NvSciSyncAttrLists.
 *
 * It is reconciled if it was:
 * - Created by a successful NvSciSyncAttrListReconcile() call,
 * - Provided by NvSciSyncObjGetAttrList(), or
 * - An import of an export of another reconciled NvSciSyncAttrList.

/**
 * \page nvscisync_page_blanket_statements NvSciSync blanket statements
 * \section nvscisync_in_out_params Input/Output parameters
 * - NvSciSyncFence passed as input parameter to an API is valid input if
 * it was first initialized to all zeroes
 * or modified by any successful NvSciSync API accepting NvSciSyncFence.
 * - NvSciSyncObj passed as an input parameter to an API is valid input if it
 * is returned from a successful call to NvSciSyncObjAlloc(), NvSciSyncObjDup(),
 * NvSciSyncObjIpcImport(), NvSciSyncIpcImportAttrListAndObj(),
 * NvSciSyncAttrListReconcileAndObjAlloc(), or NvSciSyncFenceGetSyncObj() and
 * has not yet been deallocated using NvSciSyncObjFree().
 * - NvSciSyncCpuWaitContext passed as an input parameter to an API is valid
 * input if it is returned from a successful call to
 * NvSciSyncCpuWaitContextAlloc() and has not been deallocated using
 * NvSciSyncCpuWaitContextFree().
 * - NvSciSyncModule passed as input parameter to an API is valid input if it is
 * returned from a successful call to NvSciSyncModuleOpen() and has not yet
 * been deallocated using NvSciSyncModuleClose().
 * - NvSciIpcEndpoint passed as input parameter to an API is valid if it is
 * obtained from successful call to NvSciIpcOpenEndpoint() and has not yet been
 * freed using NvSciIpcCloseEndpointSafe().
 * - Unreconciled NvSciSyncAttrList is valid if it is obtained from successful
 * call to NvSciSyncAttrListCreate() or if it is obtained from successful call to
 * NvSciSyncAttrListClone() where input to NvSciSyncAttrListClone() is valid
 * unreconciled NvSciSyncAttrList or if it is obtained from successful call to
 * NvSciSyncAttrListIpcImportUnreconciled() and has not been deallocated using
 * NvSciSyncAttrListFree().
 * - Reconciled NvSciSyncAttrList is valid if it is obtained from successful call
 * to NvSciSyncAttrListReconcile() or if it is obtained from successful call to
 * NvSciSyncAttrListClone() where input to NvSciSyncAttrListClone() is valid
 * reconciled NvSciSyncAttrList or if it is obtained from successful call to
 * NvSciSyncAttrListIpcImportReconciled() and has not been deallocated using
 * NvSciSyncAttrListFree() or has been obtained from a successful call to
 * NvSciSyncObjGetAttrList() and the input NvSciSyncObj to this call has not
 * yet been deallocated using NvSciSyncObjFree().
 * - If the valid range for the input parameter is not explicitly mentioned in
 * the API specification or in the blanket statements then it is considered that
 * the input parameter takes any value from the entire range corresponding to
 * its datatype as the valid value. Please note that this also applies to the
 * members of a structure if the structure is taken as an input parameter.
 * - NvSciSyncModule is not sharable accross processes. User must create a new
 * NvSciSyncModule using NvSciSyncModuleOpen() in every process.
 *
 * \section nvscisync_out_params Output parameters
 * - In general, output parameters are passed by reference through pointers.
 * Also, since a null pointer cannot be used to convey an output parameter, API
 * functions typically return an error code if a null pointer is supplied for a
 * required output parameter unless otherwise stated explicitly. Output
 * parameter is valid only if error code returned by an API is
 * NvSciError_Success unless otherwise stated explicitly.
 *
 * \section nvscisync_concurrency Concurrency
 * - Every individual function can be called concurrently with itself
 * without any side-effects unless otherwise stated explicitly in
 * the interface specifications.
 * - The conditions for combinations of functions that cannot be called
 * concurrently or calling them concurrently leads to side effects are
 * explicitly stated in the interface specifications.
 *
 * \section nvscisync_fence_states Fence states
 * - A zero initialized NvSciSyncFence or one fed to NvSciSyncFenceClear()
 *   becomes cleared.
 * - NvSciSyncFence becomes not cleared if it is modified by a successful
 * NvSciSyncObjGenerateFence() or NvSciSyncFenceDup().
 * - NvSciSyncFence filled by successful NvSciSyncIpcImportFence() is cleared
 * if and only if the input fence descriptor was created from a cleared
 * NvSciSyncFence.
