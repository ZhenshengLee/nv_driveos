 * \section nvscistream_input_parameters Input parameters
 * - NvSciStreamPacket passed as input parameter to NvSciStreamPoolPacketInsertBuffer()
 *   or NvSciStreamPoolPacketDelete() API is valid if it is returned from a successful call to
 *   NvSciStreamPoolPacketCreate() API and has not been deleted using
 *   NvSciStreamPoolPacketDelete().
 * - NvSciStreamPacket passed as input parameter to NvSciStreamBlockPacketAccept() or
 *   NvSciStreamBlockElementAccept() or NvSciStreamProducerPacketPresent() or
 *   NvSciStreamConsumerPacketRelease() API is valid if it was received earlier through a
 *   NvSciStreamEventType_PacketCreate event and NvSciStreamEventType_PacketDelete
 *   event for the same NvSciStreamPacket is not yet received.
 * - NvSciStreamBlock passed as input parameter to an API is valid if it is returned from
 *   a successful call to any one of the block create APIs and has not yet been destroyed
 *   using NvSciStreamBlockDelete() unless otherwise stated explicitly.
 * - An array of NvSciSyncFence(s) passed as an input parameter to an API is valid if it is not
 *   NULL and each entry in the array holds a valid NvSciSyncFence. The NvSciSyncFence(s)
 *   in the array should be in the order according to the indices specified for the NvSciSyncObj(s)
 *   during NvSciStreamBlockSyncObject() API. That is, if the NvSciSyncObj is set with index == 1,
 *   its NvSciSyncFence should be the 2nd element in the array. The array should be empty
 *   if the synchronousOnly flag received through NvSciStreamEventType_SyncAttr from
 *   other endpoint is true.
 * - NvSciIpcEndpoint passed as input parameter to an API is valid if it is obtained
 *   from successful call to NvSciIpcOpenEndpoint() and has not yet been freed using
 *   NvSciIpcCloseEndpointSafe().
 * - Pointer to NvSciEventService passed as input parameter to an API is valid if the
 *   NvSciEventService instance is obtained from successful call to
 *   NvSciEventLoopServiceCreateSafe() and has not yet been freed using NvSciEventService::Delete().
 * - The input parameter for which the valid value is not stated in the interface specification and not
 *   covered by any of the blanket statements, it is considered that the entire range of the parameter
 *   type is valid.
 *
 * \section nvscistream_out_params Output parameters
 * - Output parameters are passed by reference through pointers. Also, since a
 *   null pointer cannot be used to convey an output parameter, API functions return
 *   an error code if a null pointer is supplied for a required output parameter unless
 *   otherwise stated explicitly. Output parameter is valid only if error code returned
 *   by an API function is NvSciError_Success unless otherwise stated explicitly.
 *
 * \section nvscistream_return_values Return values
 * - Any initialization API will return NvSciError_InvalidState if it cannot be legally
 *   called in the current VM state.
 * - Any initialization API that allocates memory (for example, Block creation
 *   APIs) to store information provided by the caller, will return
 *   NvSciError_InsufficientMemory if the allocation fails unless otherwise
 *   stated explicitly.
 * - Any API which takes an NvSciStreamBlock as input parameter returns
 *   NvSciError_StreamBadBlock error if the NvSciStreamBlock is invalid.
 *   (Note: Currently in transition from BadParameter)
 * - Any API which is only allowed for specific block types returns
 *   NvSciError_NotSupported if the NvSciStreamBlock input parameter
 *   does not support the operation.
 * - Any API which takes an NvSciStreamPacket as input parameter returns
 *   NvSciError_StreamBadPacket error if the NvSciStreamPacket is invalid.
 *   (Note: Currently in transition from BadParameter)
 * - All block creation interfaces returns NvSciError_StreamInternalError error if the
 *   block registration fails.
 * - Any element level interface which operates on a block other than the interfaces for
 *   block creation, NvSciStreamBlockConnect(), NvSciStreamBlockEventQuery(), and
 *   NvSciStreamBlockEventServiceSetup() will return NvSciError_StreamNotConnected error
 *   code if the producer block in the stream is not connected to every consumer block in
 *   the stream or the NvSciStreamEventType_Connected event from the block is not yet queried
 *   by the application by calling NvSciStreamBlockEventQuery() interface.
 * - If any API detects an inconsistency in internal data structures,
 *   it will return an NvSciError_StreamInternalError error code.
 * - If an API function is invoked with parameters such that two or more failure modes are
 *   possible, it is guaranteed that one of those failure modes will occur, but it is not
 *   guaranteed which.
 *
 * \section nvscistream_concurrency Concurrency
 * - Unless otherwise stated explicitly in the interface specifications,
 *   any two or more NvSciStream functions can be called concurrently
 *   without any side effects. The effect will be as if the functions were
 *   executed sequentially. The order of execution is not guaranteed.
