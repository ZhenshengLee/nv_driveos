This sample app demonstrates the creation of an exportable texture memory
allocation in Vulkan. The allocated texture memory can be imported by multiple
vulkan/GL processes and texture data can be uploaded and manipulated as needed.

Usage:

./exttex_gen --num-clients <number [1-16]>

The value passed '--num-clients' determines the number of client apps that are
expected to connect and receive the exported FD that identifies the
texture allocation.
Default value of '--num-clients' is 1.
Max value acceptable by '--num-clients' is 16.
