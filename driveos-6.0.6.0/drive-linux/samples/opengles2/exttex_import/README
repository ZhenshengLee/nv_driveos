This sample app demonstrates the mechanism of importing vulkan texture memory
for use in a GL context to create a GL texture on top of it.
The app has the option to choose whether to write texture data into the
imported memory and then render or to use existing texture data for rendering.
Any modification made by any of the client process is reflected in other
clients as expected.

Usage:
    ./exttex_import [NVGLDEMO args] --client-id <number> --write-tex

The demo accepts all the generic arguments supported by other NVGLDEMO apps.
The additional arguments are described below:

   --client-id : [Must pass] Takes a number from 1 to 16 denoting the client id expected by the
                 vulkan allocator process.

   --write-tex : [Optional] If this flag is passed, then the process will upload random texture
                 data to the imported texture memory. This upload will modify the
                 rendering in all existing clients.

Sample usage:

If the exporting process is expecting 3 clients, then 3 instances of this app
should be invoked passing the corresponding client-id in sequence.
    ./exttex_import [NVGLDEMO args if any] --client-id 1 --write-tex
    ./exttex_import [NVGLDEMO args if any] --client-id 2
    ./exttex_import [NVGLDEMO args if any] --client-id 3 --write-tex

client-id 1 must be invoked prior to client-id 2 and 3.
client-id 2 must be invoked prior to client-id 3.
