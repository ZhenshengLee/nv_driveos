 *
 * The NvSciIpc library provides interfaces for any two entities in a system to
 * communicate with each other irrespective of where they are placed. Entities
 * can be in:
 * - Different threads in the same process
 * - The same process
 * - Different processes in the same VM
 * - Different VMs on the same SoC
 * @if (SWDOCS_NVSCIIPC_STANDARD)
 * - Different SoCs
 * @endif
 *
 * Each of these different boundaries will be abstracted by a library providing
 * unified communication (Read/Write) APIs to entities. The communication
 * consists of two bi-directional send/receive queues.
 *
 * When Init operation group APIs are used, the user should call them in the
 * following order, with or without NvSciEventService.
 *
 * <b> Typical call flow with NvSciIpc library </b>
 *
 * 1) Init mode
 *    - NvSciIpcInit()
 *    - NvSciIpcOpenEndpoint()
 *    - Set event reporting path
 *      NvSciIpcSetQnxPulseParam() (QNX OS-specific) or
 *      NvSciIpcGetLinuxEventFd() (Linux OS-specific)
 *    - NvSciIpcGetEndpointInfo()
 *    - NvSciIpcResetEndpointSafe()
 *    - Ensure a channel is established
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *      loop {
 *          NvSciIpcGetEvent()
 *          if (event & NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST_ALL) break
 *          else {
 *              NvSciIpcWaitEventQnx() (QNX OS-specific) or
 *              select(), epoll() (Linux OS-specific)
 *          }
 *      }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * 2) Runtime mode (loop)
 *    - NvSciIpcGetEvent()
 *    - If an event is not desired,
 *      call OS-blocking API
 *      NvSciIpcWaitEventQnx() (QNX OS-specific) or
 *      select(), epoll() (Linux OS-specific)
 *    - NvSciIpcReadSafe() or NvSciIpcWriteSafe()
 *
 * 3) De-Init mode
 *    - NvSciIpcCloseEndpointSafe()
 *    - NvSciIpcDeinit()
 *
 * <b> Typical call flow with NvSciIpc and NvSciEventService library </b>
 *
 * NvSciEventService provides APIs that replace OS-specific event-blocking API.
 * They are only compatible with an endpoint which is opened with
 * NvSciOpenEndpointWithEventService().
 *
 * 1) Init mode
 *    - NvSciEventLoopServiceCreateSafe() to get eventLoopService
 *    - NvSciIpcInit()
 *    - NvSciIpcOpenEndpointWithEventService()
 *    - NvSciIpcGetEventNotifier() to get eventNotifier
 *    - NvSciIpcGetEndpointInfo()
 *    - NvSciIpcResetEndpointSafe()
 *    - Ensure a channel is established
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *      loop {
 *          NvSciIpcGetEvent()
 *          if (event & NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST_ALL) break
 *          else {
 *              eventLoopService->WaitForEvent(eventNotifier)
 *          }
 *      }
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * 2) Runtime mode (loop)
 *    - NvSciIpcGetEvent()
 *    - If an event is not desired,
 *    - eventLoopService->WaitForEvent()
 *    - NvSciIpcReadSafe() or NvSciIpcWriteSafe()
 *
 * 3) De-Init mode
 *    - eventNotifier->Delete()
 *    - NvSciIpcCloseEndpointSafe()
 *    - NvSciIpcDeinit()
 *    - eventLoopService->EventService.Delete()
 *
 * <b>Using multi-threading in NvSciIpc - QNX OS</b>
 *
 * For Inter-VM and Inter-Process backend applications on QNX OS,
 * only a single event-blocking OS API (i.e. NvSciIpcWaitEventQnx(),
 * NvSciEventLoopService::WaitForEvent()) is allowed per endpoint
 * in the same process boundary.
 * If a client application tries to use receiving and sending thread separately
 * for the same endpoint handle, the event-blocking OS APIs must be used in a
 * single thread in order to receive remote notification.
 * Once a remote notification arrives in the thread, the notification should be
 * forwarded to the other thread using the same endpoint handle through any OS
 * synchronization method (e.g. sem_post, pthread_cond_signal or
 * MsgSendPulse etc.)
 * Single thread usage is recommended to handle both TX and RX data.
 *
 * <b>Configuring thread pool of resource manager - QNX OS</b>
 *
 * NvSciIpc resource manager (io-nvsciipc) and IVC resource manager (devv-nvivc)
 * use thread pool to manage concurrent request from multiple NvSciIpc client
 * processes using NvSciIpc library.
 * io-nvsciipc is used during opening endpoint and devv-nvivc is used for
 * Inter-VM IVC signaling.
 * Drive OS users should evaluate thread pool capacity of io-nvsciipc and
 * devv-nvivc then configure them with -t option in startup script.
 * Thread pool capacity for NvSciIPC can be evaluated based on number of
 * parallel outstanding NvSciIPC requests, at any point of time, that are
 * expected in the system. Default value of thread pool capacity is 10.
 *
 * <b>Getting events before using Read/Write NvSciIpc API</b>
 *
 * Before using any Read/Write APIs, the user must check if
 * @ref NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_READ or @ref NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE event is available
 * through NvSciIpcGetEvent().
 * NvSciIpcGetEvent() has additional support to establish connection between
 * two endpoint software entities.
 *
 * <b>When to use blocking API</b>
 *
 * Users of NvSciIpc must call OS event-blocking API to wait for an event when
 * NvSciIpcGetEvent() does not return desired events.
 * The following are OS event-blocking API examples:
 * - QNX  : NvSciIpcWaitEventQnx()
 * - LINUX: select(), epoll() etc.
 * - NvSciEventService: NvSciEventLoopService::WaitForEvent(),<br/>
 *                      NvSciEventLoopService::WaitForMultipleEvents()
 *
 * If user process needs to wait for events from multiple remote NvSciIpc
 * endpoint processes, use single blocking call from single thread instead of
 * using blocking call per endpoint thread. This is recommended to improve
 * performance by avoiding thread creation per endpoint.
 * NvSciEventLoopService::WaitForMultipleEvents() blocking call is suitable for
 * this use case.
 *
 * <b>How to check if peer endpoint entity receives a message</b>
 *
 * NvSciIpc library does not provide information about whether a peer endpoint
 * entity receives all sent messages from a local endpoint entity.
 * If such a mechanism is required, the client user should implement separate
 * message acknowledgment in the application layer.
 *
 * <b>Checksum for data integrity</b>
 *
 * NvSciIpc does not provide checksum for data to be transferred or check for
 * data integrity error.
 * If such a mechanism is required, the client user should implement checksum
 * processing routine for data.
 *
 * <b>Recommended Read/Write APIs</b>
 *
 * Using NvSciIpcReadSafe() and NvSciIpcWriteSafe() is recommended rather than following
 * Read/Write APIs. See detail constraints of API in each function description.
 * - NvSciIpcReadGetNextFrame()
 * - NvSciIpcWriteGetNextFrame()
 * - NvSciIpcReadAdvance()
 * - NvSciIpcWriteAdvance()
 * However, above functions are better to avoid extra memory copy.
 *
 * <b>Provide valid buffer pointers</b>
 *
 * The user of NvSciIpc must provide valid buffer pointers to NvSciIpcReadSafe(),
 * NvSciIpcWriteSafe() and other Read/Write NvSciIpc APIs as NvSciIpc library
 * validation to these parameters is limited to a NULL pointer check.
 *
 * <b>Maximum number of endpoints</b>
 *
 * One NvSciIpc client process is allowed to open up to 500 endpoints.
 * QNX NvSciIpc opens two device nodes in opening endpoint.
 * QNX OS kernel supports 1024
 * 100 open channels without disabling kernel preemption. User client needs
 * one channel/connection pair to receive an endpoint notification.
 *
 * <b>Concurrent read/write</b>
 * Client processes who want concurrent read and write operation on endpoints
 * need to open two endpoints, one for read and the other for write operation.
 * Read and write operation on different endpoint work exclusively without any
 * external locking mechanism in multiple threads. Channel memory consumption
 * will be doubled in using two endpoints.
 *
 * <b>Use ChannelCreatePulsePool() - QNX OS</b>
 *
 * In using legacy event handling (without NvSciEventService) on NvSciIpc,
 * user has to create chid and coid using ChannelCreate_r() and
 * ConnectAttach_r() before calling NvSciIpcSetQnxPulseParamSafe().
 * This ChannelCreate() uses global pulse message pool. If privileged and
 * non-privileged processes use the same global pool, unprivileged processes
 * can potentially interfere with privileged processes by receiving and not
 * handling large numbers of pulses (thereby causing denial of service attack).
 * So, ChannelCreatePulsePool() API is recommended to use fixed private pool of
 * pulses instead of using ChannelCreate_r().
 *
 * struct nto_channel_config {
 *     struct sigevent event;    // initialize using SIGEV_SEM_INIT() macro
 *     unsigned num_pulses;      // threshold to trigger semaphore event
 *     unsigned rearm_threshold; // 0 ~ num_pulses
 *     unsigned options;         // _NTO_CHO_CUSTOM_EVENT
 *     unsigned reserved[3];
 * }
 *
 * If you're experienced pulse pool shortage issue in normal operation,
 * increase num_pulses by double of previous setting.
 *
 * More information can be found in QNX OS manual page.
 *
 * In order to detect IVC signalling storm, user needs to create separate thread
 * to receive semaphore event which is set in nto_channel_config structure and
 * call sem_wait() in that thread.
 * NvSciIpcInspectEventQnx() API returns NvSciIpcEndpoint handle in which IVC
 * signalling storm happens.
 * User can decide post action (i.e. close endpoint, restart process, deinit
 * NvSciIpc etc.) per system usecase scenario after detecting issue.

/**
 * @brief Get Events
 * (safety version)
 *
 * Returns a bitwise OR operation on new events that occurred since the
 * last call to this function.
 *
 * This function sets @a events to the result of a bitwise OR operation of zero
 * or more @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_* constants corresponding to all new events that
 * have occurred on the endpoint since:
 * - the preceding call to this function on the endpoint or
 * - opening the endpoint, if this is the first call to this function on the
 *   endpoint since it was opened.
 *
 * The parameter @a events is set to zero if no new events have
 * occurred.
 *
 * There are four types of events:
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST   : IPC connection established
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE      : IPC write
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_READ       : IPC read
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_RESET : IPC connection reset
 *
 * These may occur in arbitrary combinations, except for the following:
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST is always combined with
 *   @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE.
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_RESET cannot be combined with any other events.

 * There are seven possible event combinations:
 * - 0
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST and @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST and @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE and

 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE and @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_READ
 * - @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_RESET
 *
 * An @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST event occurs on an endpoint each time a
 * connection is established through the endpoint (between the endpoint and
 * the other end of the corresponding channel).
 *
 * An @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE event occurs on an endpoint:
 * -# In conjunction with the delivery of each @c NV_SCI_IPC_CONN_EST event.
 * -# Each time the endpoint ceases to be full after a prior @c NvSciIpcWrite*
 * call returned @c NvSciError_InsufficientMemory. Note however that an
 * implementation is permitted to delay the delivery of this type of
 * @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_WRITE event, e.g., for purposes of improving throughput.
 *
 * An @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_READ event occurs on an endpoint:
 * -# In conjunction with the delivery of each @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_CONN_EST
 * event, if frames can already be read as of delivery.
 * -# Each time the endpoint ceases to be empty after a prior @c NvSciRead*
 * call returned @c NvSciError_InsufficientMemory. Note however that an
 * implementation is permitted to delay the delivery of this type of
 * @c NV_SCI_IPC_EVENT_READ event, e.g., for purposes of improving throughput.
